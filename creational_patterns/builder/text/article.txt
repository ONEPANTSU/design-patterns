Lack of sleep can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including impaired cognitive performance, mood disturbances, and increased risk of accidents.

In this article, we review the current literature on the importance of sleep for cognitive functioning. We discuss the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and the mechanisms underlying these effects. We also examine the role of sleep in memory consolidation and learning, as well as the impact of sleep on decision-making and creativity.

Overall, our review highlights the critical role of sleep in cognitive functioning and underscores the importance of getting adequate sleep for optimal health and well-being.
